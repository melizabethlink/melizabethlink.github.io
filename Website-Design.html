    <h2>The Project</h2>
    <p>The website design project is what you are currently looking at now! We spent weeks learning how to code by watching videos on StudioWeb and experiencing lessons on Kahn Academy. The main languages we learned were HTML and CSS. HTML is how you make the actual website and all of the writing that goes on it. CSS is what you use to make the website look nice. You can change the background color, font, text color, and so much more! After we completed all of the tutorials and questions, we were given a sheet of requirements and told to  use "Brackets" to build a website that displayed all of our work from technology class. I hope you like it!</p>
