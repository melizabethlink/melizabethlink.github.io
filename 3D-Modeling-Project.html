<h2>The Project</h2>
    <p>In this project the goal was to create a 3D-printed tool that could be attached onto a prosthetic arm in order to make life easier for the wearer. After completing a series of tutorials on SketchUp that taught us how to use the software, we were set loose to create our own attachment. We were allowed to choose anything we wanted and we drew out the design on a piece of paper. After our design was approved by Mrs. Trout, we spent weeks creating it on SketchUp before finally printing it out. Unfortunately i was unable to print my final design so I do not have a picture of it, but below is a picture of my design in the program simulation.</p>
