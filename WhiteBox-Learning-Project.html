    <h2>The Project</h2>
    <p>In this project, our assignment was to  create a prosthetic arm that could throw a ball into a bucket a couple feet away. However, first, we had to design a prosthetic arm on WhiteBox learning and get it to throw a ball in a simulation and land on the target. We repeated this process multiple times with different specifications. Next, we printed out a template for our wooden prosthetic arm and built in using a kit provided by WhiteBox learning. Finally, we tested our creation and attempted to land a ping pong ball in a bucket.</p>
