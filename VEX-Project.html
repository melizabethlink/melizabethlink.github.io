   <h2>The Project</h2>
    <p>In this project the main goal was to create a game that could be played with robots that we made ourself. But first, we had to learn the basics of programming. We combined our past knoweledge from our arduino project last year and the new knoweledge we gained from the rover section of WhiteBox Learning to create an interactive game. We built the robots using a kit and then worked in groups to program them to be compatible with a joystick and follow basic sequences at the push of a button. Eventually we had a competition where the robots fought to score points by placing a foam ball in a goal or on their opponent's side.</p>

In the middle, me and my groupmates, Lakshmi and Mason, are shown standing near the VEX arena with Mason controlling our robot. Finally, on the right, me and my friend Scarlett are shown building a VEX robot. </h5>
